Simultaneously Localisation and Configuration for Wireless Sensor Networks in indoor environments

## Installation

SLACjs uses bower and gulp to manage dependencies and build the project. Make sure that you have npm installed and then run:

`
npm install
gulp serve
`

This will install all dependencies and start a development server on localhost:3000.
